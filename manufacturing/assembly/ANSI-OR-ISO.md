# DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ANSIO AND ISO

If you read the main README in the root directory, you would see that there's two options for the ANSI/ISO cluster. You cannot have both sets of hotswap sockets on at the same time. For that reason, I have created two separate BOM/CPL files for either option to be assembled by default.
